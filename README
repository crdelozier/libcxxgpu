Microbenchmarks have been compiled and tested 
with gcc versions 4.5.1 and 4.6.1.  Any other versions
are not guaranteed to work due to the coupling of 
gcc versions with the libstdc++ STL implementation.

benchmarks/ contains a set of microbenchmarks that were used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of GPU acceleration for STL algorithms.

gpu/ contains the libcxxgpu headers that are common to the
implementation of GPU acceleration in each version of the STL.

include_45/ contains the GPU accelerated version of libstdc++ that matches
the gcc 4.5.1 compiler.

include_46/ contains the GPU accelerated version of libstdc++ that matches
the gcc 4.6.1 compiler.

thrust/ contains the unaltered thrust library
